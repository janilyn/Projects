# Training-and-Autocountouring-Tool
A Python program that provides an easy end-user interface for training and running a deep learning-based autocontouring tool has the capability to read, display, and manipulate micro-CT scan images in the axial, coronal, and saggittal planes.

Functions related to the training and deep learning-based autocontouring tools are excluded in this repository. Those functions are confidential and are associated with an ongoing PhD research about radiotherapy.
